    Yo! I'm a developer who loves learning and using the latest in front end web
    development. My skill set includes experience with React, Node.js, Gulp,
    Grunt, PHP, MySQL, SASS, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and Amazon Web Services
    (just to name a few).
description: >-
  My love of building web experiences started in my high school’s library in
  1997 with GeoCities and it’s been rewarding ever since! As you can imagine,
  with over 20 years of love for HTML, I have been a part of a wide variety of
  web projects: from iframes, to Flash, jQuery Mobile, and now ‘isomorphic
  JavaScript applications’. Whatever the latest trend is, I’m either deeply
  involved or experimenting with it in my spare time and imagining what’s next.
  My skills and experiences are deep, wide-ranging, and I am always seeking new
  best practices and methodologies. I embrace change, crave challenge, and love
  technology!

    Kaldi is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn about their
    java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee
    production, roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that
    knowledge to anyone. This is an edit via identity...

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
